### About The App
RocThis is a Chrome plugin that essentially adds a browser (Google Chrome) extension that uses vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML scripts. There is a business need to get Information Collection Request (ICR) data from ICRAS to ROCIS. 
1. The plugin does not interact with the server side configuration/scripts that belong to ROCIS
2. The service worker does not automatically interact with the ROCIS landscape other than visually manipulate client end scripts strictly limiting to HTML of a page. 
3. The submit button needs to be clicked by the user after data transfer is completed.
